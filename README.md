# Communities Social Network Project

A project managed and developed for/by different communities.



```
A project with a purpose to group Tunisian communities and deliver their events to the interested people in order to spread the information in a more efficient way.

Basically we need to make a place where people would sign-up to communities that they're interested in and then get updates from these communities.


```
###### The mission statement above could use a little improvement

## TODO tasks

 * <b>First</b> of all we need to manage to decompose this project to small parts. Each part can be done in a single sprint of 6 working hours (some hackathons maybe)

 * <b>Second</b> we need to make a decision about the technologies that will run the engine of this social network (languages, frameworks, design patterns..)
 

A project page and a more fluid way of communication are planned.
